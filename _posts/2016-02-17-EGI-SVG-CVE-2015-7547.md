# Update glibc by 20/02/2016 !

There is a CRITICAL-severity vulnerability in `glibc`. This affects almost every process running on a Linux system, so EGI reccomends applying the patch and simply re-booting the machine after applying package updates.

## <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Site administrators - please schedule a downtime in the GOC

The downtime should be minimal, however, if anything goes wrong, this will protect your reliability computation.

# For more information

Please see [the EGI SVG wiki](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/SVG:Advisory-SVG-CVE-2015-7547) for further details and updates.
