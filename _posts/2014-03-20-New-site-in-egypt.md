# New site !

After KENET, DIT and CNRST, we've got a new site on the ROC, hailing all the way from Egypt. This will be a Tier-3 initially for the [CMS](http://cms.cern.ch) experiment at [CERN](http://cern.ch). The site is supported by the [Academy of Scientific Research and Technology](http://http://www.asrt.sci.eg/) which is running a programme to cover all participation to the [LHC](http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/large-hadron-collider) (Large Hadron Collider - aka *Higgs Machine*).

# Status of ASRT ENHEP site

We've added the new site to the GOCDB and handed over ownership  of it to the site administrators. The site BDII is happily reporting that services are up and running and nagios agrees. Once we've got the MERAKA dev site finished (see our [work with Ansible](https://github.com/AAROC/ansible-for-grid), we'll be able to start certification of the site. 

This should be done by early next week, *insha'Allah* !
