A critical vulnerability has been discovered in the [Xen hypervisor](http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-148.html), allowing users **having root** access on the guest VM to "break out" of the context and attac the `dom0`. Xen is widely used in the [EGI FedCloud](https://www.egi.eu/infrastructure/cloud/), and is likely also used on various sites in the ROC.



Recommendations
===============

All running resources deploying Xen MUST be either patched or have mitigation in place by **2015-11-10  T21:00+01:00.**

Site administrators using Xen are requested to check the security advisory and take action if necessary, or risk suspension.
