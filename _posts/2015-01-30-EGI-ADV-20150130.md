A critical vulnerability has been announced, please update your sites. --

The [GHOST](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/01/27/9) vulnerability was announced 2 days ago - a potentially critical vulnerability in glibc.  During the January [EGI Operations Management Board meeting](https://indico.egi.eu/indico/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=2372) the issue was [discussed](https://indico.egi.eu/indico/materialDisplay.py?contribId=2&materialId=slides&confId=2372). During the discussion, it was mentioned that the attack surface for this exploit is quite small, rendering it less severe, but nonetheless critical.

[EGI-ADV-20150130](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/EGI_CSIRT:Alerts/GHOST-glibc-2015-01-30) was just announced. We've will be applying the fix to the core services and dev site, hopefully with zero downtime. All sites please update your packages.

For more info and support, contact your [CSIRT](mailto:csirt-info@sanren.ac.za), or hang out with us on [Secops-white channel](https://africa-arabia-roc.slack.com/messages/secops-white/) on Slack.
