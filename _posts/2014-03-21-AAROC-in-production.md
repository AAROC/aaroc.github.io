# TL;DR
AAROC is now in production. Integration as a Resource Infrastructure Provider has been completed with EGI.eu. Sites across the region can be registered in the GOCDB, and take advantage of central tools (monitoring, accounting, etc). To speed up deployment, we've put some effort into our Executable Infrastructure repository. 

# An agreement to stabilise an old collaboration.

The Africa-Arabia Regional Operations Centre is a distributed inititive, supported by several projects and institutes, aimed at developing a sustainable collaboration for e-Infrastructure across Africa and the Middle East. The region is defined principally by the coverage of the main regional research network alliances, [ASREN](https://www.asrenorg.net) and the [Ubuntunet Alliance](https://www.ubuntunet.net); institutes served by these regional NREN alliances are by default able to join the ROC, provided they respect the operational requirements of the collaboration. 

## The ROC : What and Why ? 

A regional operations centre can be described in two ways. It is firstly a loose collaboration of institutes, resource providers and other roleplayers in a regional e-Infrastructure. The concept of a ROC grew from the early experience of EGEE[^EGEE], and was mostly required to achieve the scalability of operations that a global infrastructure needs. Organisation of a huge collaboration requires a level of flexibility that centralised models cannot provide. In order to scale, an infrastructure needs to be able to adapt to differences in local policy and resources, while nonetheless providing as standard a possible interface to various services across the entire scope that it serves. The ROC is therefore a way for regions (be they nations, or trans-national areas) to inter-operate with each other by adopting standardised policies, procedures and tools, while maintaining autonomy in their local resources. 

## What a ROC provides

There are several other ROCs recognised by the world's grid infrastructure, such as Canada, AsiaPacific and of course the various nations such as France and Italy. Each of these provides a predefined minimum set of services whereby interoperation is achieved, such as service monitors, helpdesk, accounting portal, etc. There are
