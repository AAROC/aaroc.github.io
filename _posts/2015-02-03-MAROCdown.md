The Moroccan CA is upgrading it's services to SHA-2. This means that the MA-CNRST sites are down. --

As of 02/02/2014, the Moroccan site at MA-CNRST-01 is in a downtime, due to the unavailability of their national CA. The certificates on the services unfortunately expired at the same time as the CA planned the intervention, and we have put the site into downtime on the GOC.

The cluster is still available to local users, but no grid jobs will be scheduled there. The data management services (Storage Element and Logical File Catalogue) are also unavailable.

The situation should return to normal in a few days.
