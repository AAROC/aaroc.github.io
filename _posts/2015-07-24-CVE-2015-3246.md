# CRITICAL severity means take action now

A new critical vulnerability [has been announced](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/EGI_CSIRT:Alerts/libuser-2015-07-24) by the [EGI CSIRT](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/EGI_CSIRT:Alerts). From the advisory :

> This vulnerability is present in the case of access via a local user account and its password.

Most of the back-end infrastructure is safe (at least, in the "grid" world), since :
> Fortunately much of the access to the EGI infrastructure is NOT via this method; so much of  the EGI infrastructure is not likely to be affected.

This is true of AAROC sites as well... BUT :

> However, if access via login with a local user and password is enabled, then sites should act
> quickly to update.  One scenario in EGI where access is likely to be via this method is where
> User Interfaces (UIs) are made available with a local passwd file.  

# Perun, take the wheel !

**Some** of our UI's are managed by [Perun](https://perun.c4.csir.co.za), which is not affected, but if you are allowing user login with password, please take immediate action.

Essentially this means

```
yum update libuser
```

Stay safe and have a good weekend, y'all :smile:

# Updates

**Update 2015-07-30**

As question on the target of the advisory were raised, sites are reminded that this advisory applies to all system with libuser installed and thus that they are expected to update to a non-vulnerable version.
However, as for any vulnerability, sites can apply temporary mitigation (see the recommendations) if an update is not an option.
