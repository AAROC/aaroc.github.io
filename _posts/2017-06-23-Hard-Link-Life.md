Something strange happened a while back - although [GCC builds](https://ci.sagrid.ac.za/job/gcc-deploy/44/) were [![Build Status](https://ci.sagrid.ac.za/buildStatus/icon?job=gcc-deploy&build=44)](https://ci.sagrid.ac.za/job/gcc-deploy/44/) and the repository transaction was working, the actual compilers weren't showing up on the repository.
There just wasn't any `gcc` binary in the usual places.

Now, this is very wierd, because functional tests are run on the compilers before they are shipped - so my suspicion was aroused. The initial investigation pointed to something going wrong in the delivery part rather than the integration part.


Even after re-shipping the build artefacts, this was the case - I triggered the `shipit` job, to synchronise the `gcc` artefacts in the repo, then waited for the transaction complete. --

On my laptop :

{% highlight shell %}

cat /cvmfs/code-rade.africa-grid.org/version
FR3 Build 158 triggered by gcc
...

No gcc !? ðŸ¤”

Turns out this was due to a previous hack which we had to include in the [repository transaction step](https://ci.sagrid.ac.za/job/repo%20transaction/) of the pipeline, which removed **hard links**. Previous versions of the CVMFS server could  not handle hard links (at least this was the case when FR3 was built).

Guess what : the GCC binaries are hardlinked into `$GCC_DIR/bin` from various places - so these were getting removed in the course of the repository transaction !

This has now been fixed :
