What do our services have in common with a [Benjamin](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Benjamin&defid=1384165) ? They're both green and closely approximate 100 !

Ok, we forced that last bit, but we're pretty damn close...

With a few minor changes to the SAM-NAGIOS configuration, and some intervention at the sites, our monitor is looking *preeetty damn great*. Thanks to Tim at UCT and Sakhile and Sean for CHPC, for fixing their respective MPI tags. Next week, we plan on working on re-installing ZA-UFS and EG-ZC-T3, bringing AAROC to a full house ! Just a few accounting issues to fix and we'll be looking pretty damn good indeed.

With a release coming up at the end of January, we'll be putting more effort into user services, including improving our snappy website, so we'd like to keep this good operations status.
