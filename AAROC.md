# We are the Africa-Arabia Regional Operations Centre

The [Africa-Arabia Regional Operations Centre](http://roc.africa-grid.org) is a technical collaboration of institutes from across Africa and the Arabian states, sponsored by regional NREN Alliances - the [Ubuntunet Alliance](http://www.ubuntunet.net) in Sub-Saharan Africa and [ASREN] in North Africa and the Arabian peninsula. The mission of the ROC is to promote and support collective, coherent and sustainable interoperability of e-Infrastructures within the region and beyond, to peer infrastructures in the rest of the world. The ROC has grown out of several international projects, including a long series of FP6 and FP7 projects :

  * [EUMED](http://www.eumed.eu) project series
  * [EPIKH](http://www.epikh.eu) exchange programme
  * CHAIN and [CHAIN-REDS](http://www.chain-project.eu) project series

It is fully supported by national initiatives in South Africa, Algeria, Morocco, Egypt, Jordan, Kenya and Tanzania. This blog tells the story of maintaining and developing services for scientists in the region, focussing on technical challenges and successes, and discussing the tools of the trade.

# Coordination

The Regional Operations Centre is coordinated  by the [CSIR Meraka Institute](http://www.csir.co.za/meraka), via an MoU with [EGI.eu](http://egi.eu). Running core services which allow the exchange of operational information and service interoperability, the ROC provides transparent access to European infrastructure by Africans and vice versa.

# Operational Services

Services operated by the ROC fall into the *'Core Services'*, and *'Support Services'*.
